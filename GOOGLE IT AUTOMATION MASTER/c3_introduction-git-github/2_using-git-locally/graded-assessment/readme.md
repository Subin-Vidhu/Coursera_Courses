# Qwiklabs Assessment: Merging Branches in Git

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll use your knowledge of Git and Git commit history to check out an existing repo and make some changes to it. You'll also test what you learned about rolling back commits after bad changes in order to fix a script in the repo and run it to produce the correct output.

## What you'll do

Check the status and history of an existing Git repo

* Create a branch
* Modify content on the branch
* Make rollback changes
* Merge the branch
