# tensorflow-data-and-deployment-specialization

Below is the list of assignments and ungraded labs course-wise.
I have also included the links to the solutions of the assignments.
In the case of html files, the links are to the github page that will execute the code.
In the case of jupyter notebooks, the links are to an nbviewer page that will render it in html.
You can also execute the jupyter notebooks in colab or binder on the nbviewer page.
