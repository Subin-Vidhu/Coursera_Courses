## Module 1 Introduction

Hi! And welcome to the last course of this program.  

This module will help you put to practice some of your newly acquired Python skills. You'll make use of interesting Python libraries, understand how to read their APIs, and learn how to use the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

By the end of this module, you'll build a program that automatically resizes and rotates a bunch of images, and converts them from one image format to another.
