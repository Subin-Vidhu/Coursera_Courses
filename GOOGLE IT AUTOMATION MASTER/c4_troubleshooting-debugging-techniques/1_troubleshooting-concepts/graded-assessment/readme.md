## Qwiklabs Assessment: Debugging Python Scripts

Imagine one of your colleagues has written a Python script that's failing to run correctly. They're asking for your help to debug it. In this lab, you'll look into why the script is crashing and apply the problem-solving steps that we've already learned to get information, find the root cause, and remediate the problem.
