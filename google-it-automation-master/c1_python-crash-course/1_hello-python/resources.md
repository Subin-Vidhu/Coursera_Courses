## Using Python on your own

The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

## Additional Python resources

While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info: 

* Read the [official Python documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* Search for answers or ask a question on [Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* Subscribe to the Python [tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.
* Subscribe to the [Python-announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list) mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

## Python history and current status

Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the [History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) Wikipedia page or in the section on the [history of the software](https://docs.python.org/3.0/license.html) from the official Python documentation.

Python has recently been called the fastest growing programming language. If you're interested in why this is and how it’s measured, you can find out more in these articles:
