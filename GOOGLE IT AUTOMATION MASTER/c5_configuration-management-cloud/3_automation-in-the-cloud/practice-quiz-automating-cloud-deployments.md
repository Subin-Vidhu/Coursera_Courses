### Question 1
In order to detect and correct errors before end users are affected, what technique(s) should we set up?

* **Monitoring and alerting**
* Orchestration
* Autoscaling
* Infrastructure as Code

> Monitoring and alerting allows us to monitor and correct incidents or failures before they reach the end user.

### Question 2

When accessing a website, your web browser retrieves the IP address of a specific node in order to load the site. What is this node called?

* Gate node
* **Entry point**
* Access machine
* Front line

> When you connect to a website via the Internet, the web browser first receives an IP address. This IP address identifies a particular computer: the entry point of the website.

<br>

### Question 3

What simple load-balancing technique just assigns to each node one request at a time?

* Random
* **Round Robin**
* Least connections
* Source IP

> Round-robin load balancing is a basic way of spreading client requests across a server group. In turn, a client request will be forwarded to each server. The load balancer is directed by the algorithm to go back to the top of the list and repeat again.

### Question 4
Which cloud automation technique spins up more VMs into instance groups when demand increases, and shuts down VMs when demand decreases?

* Infrastructure as Code
* **Autoscaling**
* Load Balancing
* Orchestration

> Autoscaling helps us save costs by matching resources with demand automatically.

### Question 5
Which of the following are examples of orchestration tools used to manage cloud resources as code? (Check all that apply)

* **Terraform**
* **CloudFormation**
* **Azure Resource Manager**
* CloudFlare

> Like Puppet, Terraform uses its own domain specific language (DSL), and manages configuration resources as code.

> CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon to assist in modeling and managing AWS resources.

> Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources.
