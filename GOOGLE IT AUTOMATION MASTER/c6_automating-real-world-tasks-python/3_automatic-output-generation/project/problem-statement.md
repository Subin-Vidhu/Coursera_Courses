## Project Problem Statement

It's that time again, time to flex your programming muscles and practice solving a real-life problem with the skills you acquired!

In the next lab, you'll have to process information related to the sales your company generated last month, and turn that into a nicely formatted PDF report that you'll then send by email so that your boss can look at it. The lab machine has email configured so that you can check your resulting emails through a nice webmail interface that's already up and running.

The system that you'll work with already includes some scripts that will do part of the work for you. You'll need to put these pieces together to get the result you want, basing your code on the one that's already there.

As we called out before, solving these problems can take some time, and that's ok! Solving complex problems is the best way to really master your coding skills. Before you start the lab, make sure you understand what you need to do and that you know how you want to solve it. Nobody is rushing you, so take as much time as you need, review any concepts that are not totally clear, and then get to it.

Good luck, you can totally do this!
