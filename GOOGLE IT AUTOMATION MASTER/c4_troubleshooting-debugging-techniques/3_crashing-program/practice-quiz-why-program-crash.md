### Question 1

When using Event Viewer on a Windows system, what is the best way to quickly access specific types of logs?

* Export logs
* **Create a custom view**

### Question 2

An employee runs an application on a shared office computer, and it crashes. This does not happen to other users on the same computer. After reviewing the application logs, you find that the employee didn’t have access to the application. What log error helped you reach this conclusion?

* “No such file or directory”
* “Connection refused”
* **“Permission denied”**
* “Application terminated”

> In this case, the "Permission denied" error means that the user didn’t have access to the application executable in order to run it.

### Question 3

What tool can we use to check the health of our RAM?

* Event Viewer
* S.M.A.R.T. tools
* **memtest86**
* Process Monitor

> memtest86 and memtest86+ are memory analysis software programs designed to test and stress test the random access memory of an x86 architecture system for errors, by writing test patterns to most memory addresses, then reading data back and checking for errors.

### Question 4

You've just finished helping a user work around an issue in an application. What important but easy-to-forget step should we remember to do next?

* Fix the code
* **Report the bug to the developers**
* Reinstall the program
* Change the user’s password

> If there is a repeatable error present in a program, it is proper etiquette to report the bug in detail to the developer.

### Question 5

A user is experiencing strange behavior from their computer. It is running slow and lagging, and having momentary freeze-ups that it does not usually have. The problem seems to be system-wide and not restricted to a particular application. What is the first thing to ask the user as to whether they have tried it?

* Adding more RAM
* Reinstalling Windows
* **Identified the bottleneck with a resource monitor**
* Upgrade their HDD to an SSD

> The first step is identifying the root cause of the problem. Resource monitors such as Activity Monitor (MacOS), top (Linux and MacOS) or Resource Monitor (Windows) can help us identify whether our bottleneck is CPU-based or memory-based.
