## Module 4 Introduction

Great job, you've made it to the final module! You’ve come so far! Can you believe how much you’ve learned?

In the past few modules, you've seen how you can modify images using Python Imaging Library; how you can interact with web services using the Python requests module, sending data in JSON format; how you can generate PDF files with the content you want; and how you can send emails with those PDFs as an attachment. 

For the final project in this course, you’ll use the techniques and concepts you've seen to build a solution to a complex IT task. This can seem a bit daunting at first, but don't worry, you already have all the tools to solve this task!

In the next couple of readings, we're going to get into what to expect, and some things you should keep in mind when writing your solution.
