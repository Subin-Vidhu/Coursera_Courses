## Notes

* Branch: A pointer to a particular commit.
* The default branch that git creates for you when a new repository is initialized is called **master**.
* We can use the git branch command to list, create, delete, and manipulate branches.
* We use git checkout to check out the latest snapshot for both files and for branches.
* Merging: The term that Git uses for combining branched data and history together.
* Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge: fast-forward and three-way merge.
