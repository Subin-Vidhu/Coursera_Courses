### Question 2

What are keywords in Python?
* **Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions.**
* Keywords are used to calculate mathematical operations.
* Keywords are used to print messages like "Hello World!" to the screen.
* Keywords are the words that we need to memorize to program in Python.

> Using the reserved words provided by the language we can construct complex instructions that will make our scripts.
