## Testing in Python

<br>

In this module, you’ll learn how to create tests in Python. We’ll cover what testing is all about and dive into the differences between manual versus automated testing. Next, we’ll explore what unit tests are intended to do and how to write them. Then, we’ll learn about other test concepts like black box versus white box tests and how test-driven development can frame how you design and write your code. Finally, you’ll learn about errors and exceptions, and how to combat them.

### Key Concepts

* Understand what testing is and the different types of testing available
* Grasp the difference between black box and white box testing
* Understand the concept of test-driven development
