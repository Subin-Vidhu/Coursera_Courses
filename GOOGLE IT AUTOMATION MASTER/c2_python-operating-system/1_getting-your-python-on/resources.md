## Pointers for Getting Your Environment Setup

### Installing Python and additional modules

If you don't have Python installed yet, we recommend that you visit the [official Python website](http://www.python.org/) and download the installer that corresponds to your operating system.

There’s a bunch of guides out there for installing Python and they all follow a similar process to the one we described in the videos. This [guide from Real Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) includes instructions on how to install python on a range of different operating systems and distributions.

Once you have Python installed on your operating system, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with pip and the associated tools. You can find more info about these [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

### Using package management systems

Package management systems help you better manage the software installed on your machine. These management systems vary a lot from operating system to operating system. So, you need to pick the one that works for the OS you’re using. Check out these guides for help with this:

## Setting up Your Environment

After you’ve installed Python and checked that it works, the next step to set up your developer environment is to choose your main code editor.

These are some of the common editors for Python, available for all platforms:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can read more about these editors, and others, in these overview comparatives:

* [Top 5 Python IDEs for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-science-python-ide)

We encourage you to try out these editors and pick your favorite. Then, install it on your computer and experiment with writing and executing Python scripts locally.
