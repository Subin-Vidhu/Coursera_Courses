## Qwiklabs Assessment: Fixing Errors in Python Scripts

You're an IT professional who's in charge of the deployment and maintenance of software in your company's fleet. A piece of software that's deployed on all machines in your fleet is throwing an error on a number of these machines. You haven't written the software and don't have access to the source code. You'll need to examine the environment where the software is running in and try to work out what's going on.

### What you'll do

* Understand the error messages
* Track down the root cause and work to fix it
* Understand what to do when you can't modify the program that's throwing errors
