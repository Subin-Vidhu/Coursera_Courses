##  Notes

<br>

* `git commit -a` : A shortcut to stage any changes to tracked files and commit them in one step, if the modified file has never been committed to the repo, we'll still need to use `git add` to track it first
* Git uses HEAD alias to represent the currently checked-out snapshot of your project
* `git log -p`: `-p = patch`, gives us the patch that was created
* `git show`: Display the information about the commit and the associated path
* `git log --stat`: Show stats about the changes in the commit, like whick file were changed and how many lines were added/removed
* `git diff --staged`: See the changes that are staged but not commited
* `git rm`: Remove files from your repository, will stop the file from being tracket by git 
* `git mv`: Rename files in the repository
* .gitignore file: Ignore file that get automatically generated by our scripts that we don't want in our repo
