### Question 1

What is a production environment in Puppet?

* The software used for software development such as IDEs.
* **The parts of the infrastructure where a service is executed, and served to its users.**
* A cloud service for commercial production.
* A Virtual Machine reserved for beta software.

> Environments in Puppet are used to isolate software in development from software being served to end users.

<br>

### Question 2

What is the --noop parameter used for?

* Passing a variable called noop to Puppet
* Adding conditional rules to manifests
* Defining what operations not to perform in a manifest
* **Simulating manifest evaluation without taking any actions**

> No Operations mode makes Puppet simulate what it would do without actually doing it.

<br>

### Question 3

What do rspec tests do?

* Checks that nodes can connect to the puppet master correctly
* Check the specification of the current node
* **Check the manifests for specific content**
* Checks that the node is running the correct operating system

> We can test our manifests automatically by using rspec tests. In these tests, we can verify resources exist and have attributes set to specific values.

<br>

### Question 4

How are canary environments used in testing?

* To store unused code
* **As a test environment to detect problems before they reach the production environment**
* As a repository for alternative coding methods for a particular problem
* As a test environment for final software versions

> If we can identify a problem before it reaches all the machines in the production  environment, weâ€™ll be able to keep the problem isolated.

<br>

### Question 5

What are efficient ways to check the syntax of the manifest? (Check all that apply)

* **Run full No Operations simulations**
* **Run rspec tests**
* Test manually
* **puppet parser validate**

> In order to perform No Operations simulations, we must use the --noop parameter when running the rules.

> To test automatically, we need to run rspec tests, and fix any errors in the manifest until the RSpec tests pass.

> Using the puppet parser validate command is the simplest way to check that the syntax of the manifest is correct.
