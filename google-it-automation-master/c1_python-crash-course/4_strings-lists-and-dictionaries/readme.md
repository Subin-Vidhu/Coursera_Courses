## Strings, Lists and Dictionaries

In this module you'll dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You'll learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.

### Key Concepts

* Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
* Use lists and tuples to store, reference, and manipulate data
* Leverage dictionaries to store more complex data, reference data by keys, and manipulate data stored
* Combine these data types to construct complex data structures
