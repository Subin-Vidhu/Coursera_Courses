## Final Project

In this module, you'll put everything you've learned so far into action! You'll apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging final project: implementing a script that generates a "word cloud" from some text. You'll formulate a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you intend to solve the problem. Lastly, you'll write the code to implement your solution!

### Key Concepts

* Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
* Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
* Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
* Plan an approach to solving the problem
* Write a complex script in order to implement a solution
