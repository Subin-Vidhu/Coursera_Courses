diff
diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:

diff -u
diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output.

Patch
Patch is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the original file!

There are some other interesting patch and diff commands such as patch -p1, diff -r !
