### Question 1

When should we respond to comments from collaborators and reviewers?

* When their comments address software-breaking bugs
* No need, just resolve the concerns and be done with it
* **Always**
* Only when a code correction is necessary

Correct
Excellent! It is good manners and proper conduct to respond, even when it's simply an acknowledgement.

### Question 2

What is a nit?

* **A trivial comment or suggestion**
* A couple lines of code
* A repository that is no longer maintained
* An orphaned branch

> In git jargon (and elsewhere in the tech world), a nit is a minor “nitpick” about a piece of code.

<br>

### Question 3

Select common code issues that might be addressed in a code review. (Check all that apply)

* **Using unclear names**
* Following PEP8 guidelines
* **Forgetting to handle a specific condition**
* **Forgetting to add tests**

> Unclear names can make our code hard to understand.

> If there is a specific condition that could cause a problem and we don't address it, the result could be catastrophic.

> Tests are an important addition to our code to ensure it runs smoothly.

<br>

### Question 4

If we've pushed a new version since we've made a recent change, what might our comment be flagged as?

* Accepted
* Resolved
* **Outdated**
* Merged

> If we push a new version after making a change, old comments are marked with the "Outdated" flag.

### Question 5
What are the goals of code review? (Check all that apply)

* **Make sure that the contents are easy to understand**
* **Ensure consistent style**
* Build perfect code
* **Ensure we don't forget any important cases**

> By reviewing our code, we can identify where we can make our code more clear and easy to understand.

> By comparing our code to style guidelines, we can keep our style consistent and readable.

> Code review can reveal cases or conditions we need to handle in our code.
