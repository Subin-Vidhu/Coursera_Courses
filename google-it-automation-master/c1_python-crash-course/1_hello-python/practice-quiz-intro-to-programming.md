### Question 1

What’s a computer program?
* A set of languages available in the computer
* A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list
* **A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal**
* A file that gets copied to all machines in the network

>  At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.

## Question 2

What’s the syntax of a language?
* **The rules of how to express things in that language**
* The subject of a sentence
* The difference between one language and another
* The meaning of the words

> In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.

## Question 3

What’s the difference between a program and a script?
* **There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.**
* Scripts are only written in Python.
* Scripts can only be used for simple tasks.
* Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.

> The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.

## Question 4

Which of these scenarios are good candidates for automation? Select all that apply.
* **Generating a sales report, split by region and product type**
* Creating your own startup company
* Helping a user who’s having network troubles
* **Copying a file to all computers in a company**
* Interviewing a candidate for a job
* **Sending personalized emails to subscribers of your website**
* Investigating the root cause of a machine failing to boot

> Creating a report that presents stored data in specific ways is a tedious task that can be easily automated.

> A task like copying files to other computers is easily automated, and helps to reduce unnecessary manual work.

> Sending out periodic emails is a time-consuming task that can be easily automated, and you won't have to worry about forgetting to do it on a regular basis.

## Question 5

What are semantics when applied to programming code and pseudocode?
* The rules for how a programming instruction is written
* The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another
* **The effect the programming instructions have**
* The end result of a programming instruction

> Like human language, the intended meaning or effect of words, or in this case instructions, are referred to as semantics.
