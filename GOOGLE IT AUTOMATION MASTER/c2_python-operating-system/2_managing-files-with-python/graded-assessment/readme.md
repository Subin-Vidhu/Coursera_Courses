## Qwiklabs Assessment: Handling Files

For this lab, imagine you are an IT Specialist at a medium-sized company. The Human Resources Department at your company wants you to find out how many people are in each department. You need to write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a list of the employees in the organization, counts how many people are in each department, and then generates a report using this information. The output of this script will be a plain text file.
