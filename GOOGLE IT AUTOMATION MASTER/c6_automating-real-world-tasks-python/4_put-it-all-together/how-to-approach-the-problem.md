## How to Approach the Problem

We're giving you a pretty big project to do at the end of this course -- but you can totally complete it with what you've learned until now! Take your time, and be methodical. Use these tips to help you:

**Break the problem down into smaller pieces**. If you’re not sure how to solve a piece of the puzzle, look for an even smaller piece that you can solve. Build up those smaller pieces into a larger solution!

**Make one change at a time**. Write unit tests to make sure that each new part of the solution works the way you think it does. Run your unit tests frequently to make sure that each part of your solution **keeps working** as you make changes.

**Use version control**. Check each part of your solution into version control as you complete it, so you can always roll back to a known version of your code if you make a mistake.

***Review module documentation!*** You are going to need to use these modules to complete the final project. Reading the documentation takes time, but as you become more familiar with the APIs provided by these modules, it could save you from writing a bunch of custom code that could have just been a call to a module function! Remember, we’ve covered these modules in previous lessons too, so feel free to go back and review them if you need a refresher!
