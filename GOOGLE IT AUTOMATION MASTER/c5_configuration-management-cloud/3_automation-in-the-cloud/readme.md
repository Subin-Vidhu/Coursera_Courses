## Automation in the Cloud

In this module, you’ll learn about cloud services and the different types of cloud services, like SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Next, you’ll learn about scaling in the cloud and how to modify the capacity of your service. You’ll learn about horizontal and vertical scaling, which then ties into automatic versus manual scaling. Next, you’ll explore how much control you have over your system, depending on whether you choose SaaS, Paas, or IaaS, and assess which one is right for your business. You’ll rundown the options available to migrate your business to the cloud using strategies like lift and shift. In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to manage instances in the cloud by creating one! You’ll explore the different options available, like regions, machine types, and lots more. Then, you’ll look into customizing and templating virtual machines to enable you to deploy them at scale. Our final lesson will explore the concept of automating cloud deployments. You’ll learn about load balancers, which ensure that each node receives a balanced number of requests, as well as autoscaling, which shuts nodes on and off, as needed. Next, you’ll learn about orchestration and how orchestration and automation differ. Last up, you’ll learn about infrastructure as code (IaC), or machine readable configuration files that automate configuration management.
