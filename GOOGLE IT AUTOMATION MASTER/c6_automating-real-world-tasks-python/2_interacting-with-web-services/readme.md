## Module 2 Introduction

Congratulations on making it through the first lab in this course!

Remember that putting your Python skills to practice with exercises like this one is the way to getting the hang of it all. By practicing solving complex challenges, you'll become a lot more confident in your programming abilities, and you'll be able to achieve a lot more.

In this module, we'll look into a bunch of different tools that can be really useful in today's IT world. You'll first learn how you can use different text formats to store data in text files, retrieve it, and even transmit it over the internet.

Later on, we'll look into how we can get our code to interact with services running on different computers using a module called Python Requests.

We'll see a bunch of different examples and give you pointers to more information. Don't forget that the best way to get comfortable with all these modules and libraries is to come up with your own examples and practice writing scripts on your local computer!
