## Module 3 Introduction

Welcome back! And congratulations on completing yet another tricky lab.

As you get to practice your Python skills you're probably starting to see that there's a lot more to learn out there. And that's true, there's a lot of tools to help us do a ton of different things. But don't panic! You don't need to learn all these tools at the same time.  This course is designed to help you get a first taste of some of the tools available, so that you can learn about more tools in the future. As you keep writing more and more programs, you'll keep coming across more and more tools, expanding your Python skills and knowledge.

In this module, we'll look into a different aspect of automation: automating the generation of nicely formatted output from our scripts, like sending emails.

Most of us use email for a bunch of different things, all the time. We type up an email message, sometimes  attach a picture or a document, and send it to someone in our contact list. Have you ever used a script to send an email? By the end of this module, youâ€™ll be able to send an email message with an attachment from Python! You'll even learn how to generate PDF files to attach to those emails.

To help with that, we'll look into a bunch of different Python modules that already include a lot of the functionalities that we want. As we've called out, this is one of the great things about Python -- we can use these modules to accomplish what we want with very little code!

We'll show examples of how you can do a bunch of different operations, like creating the contents of the email or the PDF, attaching a file to an email, and even sending the email to an SMTP server. As always, we recommend that you follow along on your own computer, and even try to come up with new ways to use these libraries.

At the end, you'll have the opportunity to put all of this in practice through the lab.
