## Notes

* `git checkout`:  reverts changes to modified files before they are staged.
* `git add *`: the star is a file glob pattern, that expands to all files
* `git commit --ammend`: overwrite the previous commit
* Avoid amending commits that have already been made public
* `git revert`: creates a commit that contains the inverse of all the changes made in the bad commit in order to cancel them out
