## Project Problem Statement

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.

For this lab, the service is running on the same machine, and you can actually look at how all of it is implemented, if you want.  But you don't need to change the service implementation to complete the exercise.

Remember that you can take your time to prepare the code that youâ€™ll write. You can start the lab later on, once you have a good idea of what you'll do and how you'll do it.

Also, feel free to check out the resources that we pointed to as many times as you need.

Good luck, you've got this!
