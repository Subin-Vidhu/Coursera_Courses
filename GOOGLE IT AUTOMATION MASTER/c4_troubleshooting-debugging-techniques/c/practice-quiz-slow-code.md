### Question 1

Which of the following is NOT considered an expensive operation?

* Parsing a file
* Downloading data over the network
* Going through a list
* **Using a dictionary**

> Using a dictionary is faster to look up elements than going through a list.

<br>

### Question 2

Which of the following may be the most expensive to carry out in most automation tasks in a script?

* **Loops**
* Lists
* Vector
* Hash

> Loops that run indefinitely, and include subtasks to complete before moving on can be very expensive for most automation tasks.

<br>

### Question 3

Which of the following statements represents the most sound advice when writing scripts?

* Aim for every speed advantage you can get in your code
* Use expensive operations often
* **Start by writing clear code, then speed it up only if necessary**
* Use loops as often as possible

> If we don't notice any slowdown, then there's little point trying to speed it up.

### Question 4

In Python, what is a data structure that stores multiple pieces of data, in order, which can be changed later?

* A hash
* Dictionaries
* **Lists**
* Tuples

> Lists are efficient, and if we are either iterating through the entire list or are accessing elements by their position, lists are the way to go.

<br>

### Question 5

What command, keyword, module, or tool can be used to measure the amount of time it takes for an operation or program to execute? (Check all that apply)

* time
* **kcachegrind**
* **cProfile**
* break

> We can precede the name of our commands and scripts with the "time" shell builtin and the shell will output execution time statistics when they complete.

> The kcachegrind tool is used for profile data visualization that, if we can insert some code into the program, can tell us how long execution of each function takes.

> cProfile provides deterministic profiling of Python programs, including how often and for how long various parts of the program executed.
