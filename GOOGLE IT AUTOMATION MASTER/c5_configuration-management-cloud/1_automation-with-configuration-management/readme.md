## Automating with Configuration Management

In this module, you’ll be introduced to the concept of automation at scale and how it can be successfully achieved. You’ll learn what it means to work at scale and how automation is needed to scale effectively. Next, you’ll be introduced to configuration management. You’ll learn the differences between unmanaged and managed configuration management. Then, you’ll dive into infrastructure as code and learn about the benefits it brings, like making your fleet of nodes more reliable and repeatable. This is a major benefit when managing systems at scale. In the next lesson, you’ll be introduced to Puppet. You’ll learn how to apply basic configuration management and how Puppet agents and masters interact with each other. Next, you’ll do a rundown of Puppet resources and classes. You’ll learn how resources are basic units for modelling your configurations and how classes are a collection of resources used to achieve a single goal. The final lesson will introduce you to the building blocks of domain-specific language. You’ll learn what Puppet facts are and how it uses a program called facter to analyze, store and gather this information. Your final lesson will cover the driving principles of configuration management. You’ll learn about declarative, procedural, and idempotent principals and how they differ from each other.
