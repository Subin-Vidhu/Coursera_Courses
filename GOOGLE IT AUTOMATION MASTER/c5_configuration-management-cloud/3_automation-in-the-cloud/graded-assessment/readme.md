## Qwiklabs Assessment: Create VM template and Automate deployment

You're an IT Administrator for your company and you're assigned to work on a project that requires you to deploy eight virtual machines (VMs) as web servers. Each of them should have the same configuration. You'll create a VM, set up an auto-enabled service, and make it a template. Then, you'll use the template to create seven more VMs.

### What you'll do

* Create a VM using GCP web UI and make a template out of it
* Use a command-line interface to interact with VMs
* Learn how to configure an auto-enabled service
* Learn to use gcloud to deploy VMs with a template
